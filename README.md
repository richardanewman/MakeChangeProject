## Make Change Project

### First Week Homework for Skill Distillery

### Overview

This program simulates a cash transaction interface. The assignment required me to independently write a program to calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered.


### Tasks

### \#1
Prompt attendant for item price.

### \#2
User is then prompted to enter the amount tendered by the customer.

### \#3
Give the attendant the correct change in denomination values: for example if .67 was the item price and the amount tendered 1.00, the program should output 1 quarter, 1 nickel, 3 pennies. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed.

### \#4
Display an appropriate message if the customer provided too little money or the exact amount.

### \#5
If the amount tendered is more than the cost of the item, display the number of bills and coins that should be given to the customer.


### How to run

To run this program, download or clone this MakeChange repository to a local directory. Open the Eclipse IDE (or your favorite Java compiler) and import the project under the File menu. Or clone the repository directly into your IDE via terminal.
